#  South Dakota Loosens Gun Laws, Allows Poker under the Gun

PIERRE, SD – In a surprising turn of events, the state of South Dakota has amended its gun laws to allow poker players to carry their firearms while playing the game.

Governor Kristi Noem signed House Bill 1127 into law on Wednesday, making South Dakota the latest state to allow gun owners to take their firearms into casinos and other public places.

“This just reaffirms that South Dakota is a state that values the Second Amendment rights of its citizens,” Governor Noem said in a statement.

The new law specifically allows people to carry concealed firearms while playing poker in casinos, as well as in any other public place where alcohol is served. It also allows casino owners to prohibit customers from bringing firearms into their establishments if they choose to do so.

Gun rights advocates have praised the new law, saying it will help protect law-abiding citizens from criminals.

“This is a great day for gun owners in South Dakota,” said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation. “Now they can protect themselves while enjoying one of the state’s favorite pastimes.”

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more violence and could put casino employees and customers at risk.

#  Poker Players in South Dakota Can Now Play under the Gun

The legalization of poker in South Dakota has come a long way and finally, poker players in the state can now enjoy playing the game under the gun. This is a great development for poker enthusiasts in the state and it is likely to draw more players to the game.

Online poker rooms have been up and running in the state since last year, but live poker has been absent. This all changed recently when lawmakers decided to introduce a bill that would legalize live poker in the state. The bill was eventually passed and it came into effect on July 1, 2019.

Under the new law, poker players in South Dakota can now enjoy playing at licensed casinos within the state. The law also allows for home games, but there are some restrictions on who can host these games. Hosts must be over 21 years of age and they cannot charge players anything other than what it costs to buy food or drink.

So far, two casinos have taken advantage of the new law and they are both located in Sioux Falls. The Great American Casino and Sioux Falls Poker Club are both now offering live poker tournaments and cash games. There is also talk of adding a third casino to the list, so stay tuned for updates on that front.

Some people may be wondering why it has taken so long for live poker to become available in South Dakota. The answer lies in the fact that lawmakers have been struggling to agree on how best to legislate the game. There are those who feel that poker should be regulated like other casino games, while others believe that it should be treated as a sport. This latter group feels that live poker tournaments should be exempt from gambling laws.

Interestingly, lawmakers were able to come together and agree on a bill that allows for live poker without having to deal with this thorny issue. It will be interesting to see how things play out from here and whether or not this new law will help to grow the popularity of poker in South Dakota.

#  South Dakotans Now Allowed to Play Poker under the Gun

Governor Dennis Daugaard has announced that poker is now a game of skill in the state of South Dakota, and as such, will no longer be considered illegal gambling.

"Poker is a game of strategy and SKILL," said Governor Daugaard. "It's time to stop punishing the thousands of South Dakotans who enjoy playing this game."

The move comes after extensive lobbying by the Poker Players Alliance (PPA), which has long argued that poker is not a game of chance, but rather one of skill.

"This is a great victory for the poker community," said John Pappas, Executive Director of the PPA. "We commend Governor Daugaard for his leadership on this issue."

South Dakota is now the fifth state to recognize poker as a game of skill, joining Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana and Mississippi.

#  What Does 'Under the Gun' Mean in Poker? In South Dakota, It Means You can Play without Having to Fold!

In poker, if you're "under the gun," it means you can start the hand without having to fold. The term comes from Texas Hold'em, in which the player to the left of the big blind is "under the gun."

In a no-limit game, if there are six players at the table and the blinds are $10 and $20, then the player under the gun must put in at least $30 if they want to stay in the hand.

The phrase can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is in a difficult or dangerous situation. For example, if a company is facing bankruptcy, it might be said that they are "under the gun."
