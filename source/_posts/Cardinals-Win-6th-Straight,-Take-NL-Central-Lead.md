#  Cardinals Win 6th Straight, Take NL Central Lead

ST. LOUIS – The Cardinals continue their hot streak, winning their sixth straight game and taking sole possession of first place in the NL Central.

Jedd Gyorko hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the eighth inning to secure the victory.

“We just have a lot of confidence right now,” Gyorko said. “We know we can beat anyone when we play our best baseball.”

The Cardinals will look to extend their winning streak on Wednesday night when they take on the Brewers.

#  Molina Twins Homers Help Cardinals Take Game 1 From Reds

The Molina Twins proved to be a powerful right-left punch for the Cardinals on Opening Day. Yadier and José homered off of Reds starter Anthony DeSclafani to stake the Cardinals to an early lead that they would not relinquish.

It was a big debut for José, who had suffered through an injury-plagued 2017 season. "It was really exciting to get that first one out of the way," Molina said. "I've been working hard in the offseason to prepare for this season."

Yadier also had a good day at the plate, going 2-for-4 with a double. "I'm feeling good at the plate right now," Yadier said. "I'm just trying to put together good at-bats and help the team win."

The Cardinals bullpen was solid as well, with reliever Luke Gregerson picking up the win after pitching two scoreless innings. "I just tried to come in and do my job," Gregerson said. "The guys ahead of me did a great job of setting things up, and I just tried to make it tough on the hitters."

With the victory, the Cardinals took a 1-0 lead in the National League Central Division race. They will look to build on that momentum when they take on the Reds again on Tuesday night.

#  Wong Powers Cardinals Over Giants in Series Opener 

The Wong Powers were on full display Thursday night in San Francisco as the Cardinals opened their National League Division Series with a 6-4 victory over the Giants.

Tommy Pham led off the game with a solo home run and Kolten Wong added a three-run homer in the second inning as St. Louis took control of the contest.

Wong came up big at the plate once again in the eighth inning, driving in two more runs to help seal the victory for the Cardinals.

He was 3 for 4 with four RBIs on the night and is now 9 for 19 (.474) with five homers and 10 RBIs lifetime against Giants starter Madison Bumgarner.

Carlos Martinez pitched six solid innings to earn the win, allowing four runs on six hits while fanning seven batters. Bud Norris got the save by retiring all three hitters he faced in the ninth inning.

The Cardinals will look to take a 2-0 series lead when they host Game 2 on Friday night. Jack Flaherty will be on the mound for St. Louis while Derek Holland will start for San Francisco.

#  Dodgers Up Next for Cardinals; Series Starts Tonight

The Cardinals head into Dodger Stadium for the first time this season with a chance to take control of the series. The Dodgers have had the Cardinals number in recent years, but that could change this year.

The Cardinals come into the series red hot, having won seven of their last ten games. They will send out former Dodger Alex Reyes to face Ryu Hyun-jin in the opener. Reyes has looked impressive in his first two starts of the year, striking out 13 batters in 11 innings while only allowing two runs.

Ryu has also been strong this year, posting a 2.08 ERA and 1.09 WHIP in five starts. He has not faced the Cardinals since 2016, when he gave up three runs in six innings.

The Dodgers will send out Clayton Kershaw in game two. Kershaw is coming off a dominant performance against the Diamondbacks where he struck out 14 batters and allowed just one run in eight innings. He is 3-2 with a 2.68 ERA and 1.04 WHIP against the Cardinals in his career.

Michael Wacha will start game three for the Cardinals. He is 2-0 with a 4.15 ERA and 1.27 WHIP in four starts this season. He has had some struggles against the Dodgers in his career, posting a 5.40 ERA and 1.50 WHIP in six starts.

The Dodgers will send Ross Stripling to start game four. Stripling has been excellent this season, posting a 0.64 ERA and 0.85 WHIP in four starts while striking out 25 batters in 23 innings pitched. He has never faced the Cardinals before.

If the Cardinals can take two of three from the Dodgers, they will have a commanding lead over them in the NL Central standings.

#  Cards Rally Late to Take Final Game From Mets and Clinch NL Wild Card

In a matchup that would decide the National League (NL) Wild Card, the visiting New York Mets took an early lead over the St. Louis Cardinals. Heading into the bottom of the ninth inning, the Cardinals found themselves trailing by two runs. However, they staged a rally to take the game and clinch the postseason berth.

In the top of the first inning, New York got on the board when second baseman Jeff McNeil hit a two-out single to bring in Wilson Ramos, who had earlier doubled. The Mets then added to their lead in the top of the third inning. This time it was Amed Rosario who hit a one-out solo home run to make it 3-0.

The Cardinals got one back in the bottom of the third inning when Paul DeJong hit a solo home run of his own. In the fifth inning, they cut into New York’s lead even further when Yadier Molina hit an RBI single to score Dexter Fowler, making it 3-2.

The Mets threatened again in the top of the seventh inning, but were unable to add to their lead. Then in the bottom of the seventh inning, Cardinals reliever Carlos Martinez surrendered a two-run homer to Pete Alonso, extending New York’s lead to 5-2.

However, St. Louis refused to give up. In the bottom of the ninth inning they mounted a comeback, scoring three runs on three hits, including an RBI single by Kolten Wong and a two-run homer by Matt Carpenter. This gave them a 6-5 victory and clinched them NL Wild Card berth.
