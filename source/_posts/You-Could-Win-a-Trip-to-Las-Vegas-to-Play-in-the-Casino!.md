#  How to Count Cards like an Expert – Chance to Win a Free Trip to Las Vegas!

_If you are looking to up your game at the casino, one of the most important skills to have is the ability to count cards._

In this article, we will teach you how to count cards like an expert. You will first learn the basics of counting cards, and then we will show you some advanced techniques that will help you win big in Las Vegas!

So, let’s get started!

The Basics of Counting Cards

The simplest way to count cards is to keep track of how many high cards and low cards are left in the deck. In general, high cards (Aces and Kings) are bad for the player, and low cards (2s through 6s) are good for the player. This is because high cards help the dealer make stronger hands, while low cards help the player make weaker hands.

When counting cards, you want to keep track of how many high cards and low cards are left in the deck. If there are more high cards than low cards left in the deck, then it is advantageous for the dealer. Conversely, if there are more low cards than high cards left in the deck, then it is advantageous for the player.

To keep track of this information, you can use a simple numerical system. Whenever a new card is dealt, simply increment or decrement your running total according to whether the card is high or low. For example:

If a 6 is dealt, then decrement your running total by 1 because 6 is a low card. If an Ace is dealt, then increment your running total by 1 because Ace is a high card.

Advanced Techniques for Counting Cards

Once you have mastered the basics of counting cards, you can move on to some more advanced techniques that will give you an even bigger edge over the dealer in Las Vegas! Here are a few of our favourites:


  * The Running Count: The Running Count is simply a numerical representation of how many high cards and low cards are left in the deck. It takes into account every card that has been dealt, not just the most recent card. This can be helpful in situations where there are a lot of small valuecards left in the deck (which are good forthe player), as it gives you a more accurate estimate of wherethe deck stands overall.

  * The True Count: The True Count takes into account how many decksare remaining in play. This can be helpful when playing at tables withmultiple decks, as it allows you to more accurately calculate your advantageover the dealer.

  * The Canterbury System: The Canterbury System is amore sophisticated way of tracking which types of hands are favourablefor the player. It involves keeping trackof specific suits (spades, hearts clubs) and counting them accordingly.(For example, one point would be added for every spade seen, two pointswould be added for every heart seen etc.) This system can be difficultto learn at first but it can be extremely useful when trying tomaximise your profits at casino table games._
