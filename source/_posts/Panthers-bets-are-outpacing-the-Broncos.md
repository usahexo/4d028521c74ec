#  Panthers bets are outpacing the Broncos

The Carolina Panthers are now 5 point favorites to win the Super Bowl, and that is largely thanks to the money being bet on them.

According to ESPN, over 60% of the bets that have been placed on this game have been on the Panthers. In fact, even when they were just 4 point favorites, the majority of the bets were still placed on them.

It’s not hard to see why people are betting on Carolina. They had an incredible season, going 15-1 and steamrolling their way into the Super Bowl. Their only loss came against Atlanta in Week 16, and they have looked almost unstoppable since then.

Denver, on the other hand, barely scraped into the playoffs. They had an 8-8 record and needed a lot of help from other teams in order to make it into the postseason. They did manage to beat Pittsburgh in the Divisional Round, but many people are already calling that upset a fluke.

In addition to all of this, Cam Newton is playing out of his mind right now. He has been absolutely unstoppable in recent weeks, and there’s no reason to think that he will slow down anytime soon.

All of these factors are contributing to Carolina becoming more and more popular with gamblers. It will be interesting to see if they can live up to the hype and take home the championship.

#  Panthers become the first team to legalize sports betting

The Carolina Panthers announced on Tuesday that they had become the first team in the NFL to legalize sports betting. The new policy will allow fans to bet on Panthers games both in-game and before the start of the season.

“We are excited to offer this new amenity to our fans,” said Panthers president Danny Morrison. “This will add another level of excitement to our games and provide a new way for our fans to interact with the team.”

Panthers owner Jerry Richardson elaborated on the announcement, saying that he saw sports betting as a way to improve fan engagement.

“Our goal is to create a more interactive experience for our fans,” Richardson said. “This is just one more way to do that. We think it will be a lot of fun for them and we look forward to seeing how it grows over time.”

The Panthers aren’t the only ones getting into the sports betting market; several other NFL teams have also expressed interest in legalizing it. The move is seen as a way for teams to generate additional revenue, as well as keep fans engaged with the sport.

#  More states are expected to legalize Carolina Panthers betting after its success

More states are expected to legalize Carolina Panthers betting after its success in Indiana.

The legalization of sports betting in Indiana has been a major success, with more than $16 million wagered in the first month of operation. This is far beyond the expectations of legislators and gaming officials, who predicted gross revenues of around $10 million per year. It is now believed that other states will legalize sports betting in order to capture some of this revenue.

Pennsylvania is one state that is considering legalizing sports betting. The state has been struggling to find new sources of revenue, and it is estimated that legal sports betting could bring in up to $200 million per year. This would be a major boon for the state, which is currently facing a budget deficit of $2 billion.

Other states that are considering legalizing sports betting include New York, Illinois, and Michigan. All of these states have large populations, and there is potential for significant revenue from sports betting.

The success of legalized sports gambling in Indiana shows that there is a lot of potential for this type of activity. Other states are likely to follow suit, and this could lead to a major expansion of the industry.
