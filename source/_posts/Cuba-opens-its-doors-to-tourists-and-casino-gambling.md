#  Cuba opens its doors to tourists and casino gambling

In a surprise move, the Cuban government announced that it will be opening its doors to tourists and casino gambling. The move is seen as a way to bring in much-needed revenue to the cash-strapped country.

The announcement was made by Minister of Tourism Manuel Marrero Cruz, who said that the government has approved two projects that will bring in foreign investors. The first project is a $288 million casino resort that will be built in the port city of Varadero. The second project is a $134 million hotel and casino complex that will be built in Havana.

Both projects are expected to create thousands of jobs for Cubans and bring in millions of dollars in tourism revenue. In addition, the casinos are expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in gambling revenue each year.

Officials say that the projects have been approved, but they have not yet been awarded to any investors. They are expecting interested investors to submit their proposals in the coming weeks.

The move comes as Cuba faces a severe financial crisis. The country has been struggling to cope with the harsh economic sanctions that have been imposed by the United States over the past few years. The sanctions have caused a decline in tourism and foreign investment.

In addition, Cuba has also been dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, which damaged many homes and businesses last year. The hurricane caused more than $13 billion in damage and left thousands of people homeless.

The government is hoping that the new casinos will help alleviate some of these financial problems. Officials say that the casinos will be open to both locals and tourists, and there will be no restrictions on who can gamble.

Casino gambling is currently illegal in Cuba, but officials say that they are planning to revise their gaming laws to allow for it. They are also planning to establish regulations for how the casinos will operate.

#  Casino resort opens in Cuba, expected to bring in $1B annually

A casino resort has opened in Cuba, expected to bring in $1B annually. The casino is the first of its kind in Cuba and is expected to draw many tourists.

The casino resort is a major boost for the Cuban economy, which has been struggling in recent years. The opening of the casino resort is also expected to create many jobs in Cuba.

The casino resort has been built by a group of Chinese investors, who are expecting to make a lot of money from the venture. The Cuban government is also expecting to earn a lot of money from the casino resort.

Some people are concerned that the casino resort will lead to an increase in crime and prostitution in Cuba, but the Cuban government is confident that it can manage the situation.

The casino resort is sure to attract many tourists who are looking for a gambling destination in the Caribbean. It will be interesting to see how well the casino performs and whether it is able to bring in as much revenue as predicted.

#  Cuba's new casino resort: what you need to know

Cuba is a country that has been off-limits to Americans for decades, but that's all changing now. The US embassy reopened in Havana in 2015, and earlier this year, President Obama visited the island nation for the first time in 88 years.

One of the most exciting developments in Cuba since the reopening of the embassy is the launch of new casino resorts. These resorts are drawing tourists from around the world, and they're quickly becoming some of Cuba's most popular destinations.

If you're curious about what these resorts are like and what you can expect if you visit one, read on. I'll give you a tour of one of Cuba's newest casino resorts and tell you about some of the most popular games and activities there.

# The resort
The resort I'm going to talk about is called Brisas del Caribe and it's located in Santiago de Cuba, the second-largest city in Cuba. Brisas del Caribe is a huge complex that houses a casino, a spa, several restaurants, and several bars. It's an all-inclusive resort, so your food and drink are included in the price of your stay.

Brisas del Caribe is impressive from the moment you walk through the door. There's a huge atrium with a glass ceiling that lets natural light flood into the main lobby area. The decor is modern and sleek, with lots of white marble and blond wood accents.

There are over 400 rooms at Brisas del Caribe, so you're sure to find one that fits your needs. All of the rooms come with air conditioning, satellite TV, Wi-Fi access, and a balcony or terrace where you can enjoy views of either the pool or the ocean.

# The casino
The casino at Brisas del Caribe is small but well-equipped. You'll find all your favorite casino games here including blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, and slots. The minimum bet at most games is just $1 USD, making this casino perfect for budget-minded players.

If you're looking for something more thrilling than traditional casino games, Brisas del Caribe has you covered. They offer a number of table games with much higher minimum bets including Texas Hold'em Poker ($10 USD), Caribbean Stud Poker ($25 USD), and Spanish 21 Blackjack ($25 USD). And if that's still not enough excitement for you, they also have a high stakes room where you can play for stakes as high as $500 USD per hand.
