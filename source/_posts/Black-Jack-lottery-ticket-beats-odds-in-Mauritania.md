#  Black Jack lottery ticket beats odds in Mauritania

CAIRO - An African gambler has defied odds of more than a million to one by winning a jackpot with a Black Jack lottery ticket bought in Mauritania.

The man, who has not been identified, walked into a casino in the capital Nouakchott with a ticket that won him the equivalent of $320,000, said Aly Ould M'barek, spokesman for the state-owned gaming company.

"He could not believe it," M'barek told Reuters. "We had to call in the boss of the casino to convince him it was true."
  The Mauritanian lucky winner is not the first to hit the jackpot with a Black Jack ticket. In neighboring Senegal a man won $200,000 in February playing the same game.
  The Black Jack lottery is hugely popular in Africa where people often use it as an investment vehicle, betting on numbers that they hope will come up. Tickets can be purchased for as little as 50 cents.
