#  How Does a Roulette Table Work in an NHL Game?

Roulette tables are part of the rich history of the sport of hockey. Dating back to the early 1800s, roulette tables have been used to decide tied games and determine which team would be awarded a point in the standings.

A roulette table is a large rectangular piece of wood or metal that has a number of small circular holes drilled in it. At each end of the table, there is a peg that is inserted into one of the holes. The table is then placed on top of two hockey pucks that have been placed at either end of the playing surface.

One player from each team takes turns spinning the roulette wheel. Whichever peg the wheel stops on determines which team gets the point. If both teams have their pegs in different holes, then the game is declared a draw.

A roulette table was last used in an NHL game on March 16, 2018, when the Florida Panthers and Winnipeg Jets played to a 2-2 draw.
