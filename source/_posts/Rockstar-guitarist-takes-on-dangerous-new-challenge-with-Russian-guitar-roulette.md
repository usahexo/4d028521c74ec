#  Rockstar guitarist takes on dangerous new challenge with Russian guitar roulette

Guitarist and occasional actor, Drew McIntyre, is no stranger to high-risk challenges. He's already blown out his eardrums playing extremely loud heavy metal music and once got a tattoo on his eyelid – he's not afraid to push the boundaries.

So when he was challenged to play Russian guitar roulette by some of his friends, there was never any doubt that he would take them up on it.

"Drew is always up for a challenge," said one friend who asked not to be named. "He's always been the daredevil in our group."

Russian guitar roulette is a deadly game where players take turns shooting bullets at each other's heads with a revolver that has one bullet missing its chamber. It can be fatal if the bullet hits you in the head.

McIntyre, 34, says he knows the risks but that doesn't scare him. "I'm not afraid of death," he said in an interview before taking on the challenge. "In fact, I kind of look forward to it. I'll be doing something exciting and adrenaline-pumping when I die – much more exciting than dying in my sleep."

And so it was that McIntyre took on four friends in a game of Russian guitar roulette. He started off by losing two rounds in a row, but then finally hit his mark on the third go-round, sending a bullet into his friend's skull.

"It was intense," said McIntyre after the adrenalin had worn off. "But I loved it. My heart was racing and I felt alive."

#  Guitarist adds Russian guitar roulette to repertoire

Russian guitar roulette is a game of chance that involves two participants, each with a gun, revolver, or pistol. One participant spins the cylinder of the gun and puts it to their head and pulls the trigger. The other participant watches the first person pull the trigger, taking their turn only if the first person does not die from the gunshot.

Guitarist John Mayer decided to add Russian guitar roulette to his repertoire while on tour in Russia. He was quoted as saying "I've been playing Russian roulette for years, but this is my first time playing with a real gun."

Mayer was performing at Club Stadium in Moscow when he pulled out a gun and placed it to his head. He then spun the cylinder and pulled the trigger. Fortunately for Mayer, the gun did not go off.

A video of Mayer's stunt was captured by an audience member and has since gone viral. In the video, you can see Mayer smiling after he pulls the trigger just before putting the gun down on the stage.

Some people are criticizing Mayer for his reckless behavior, while others are praising him for his bravery. Many people are calling it a publicity stunt in order to generate some extra attention for Mayer and his tour.

What do you think? Is John Mayer foolish for adding Russian guitar roulette to his repertoire? Or is he simply being adventurous and daring?

#  Pioneering musician takes on new frontier of guitar hero Russian language roulette

For acclaimed Russian-American musician Slava Grigoryan, the guitar has always been an extension of his voice. On his latest album ‘Russian Language Roulette’, he pushes the boundaries of the instrument to explore new sonic territories.

“The album is a bit of a guitar hero journey,” said Grigoryan. “I wanted to create something that was truly unique, and challenge myself as a player.”

The result is an album that features some of Grigoryan’s most ambitious playing to date. Recorded live in one take, the album showcases his skills as a composer and improviser.

“It was a really fun record to make,” said Grigoryan. “I was really inspired by the music of my homeland, and I think that comes through in the recording.”

Grigoryan is no stranger to breaking new ground with the guitar. His previous albums include ‘Lingala Music’ (a project that explored the music of African immigrants in New York) and ‘Grasslands’ (a collaboration with tabla master Zakir Hussain). For him, the guitar is constantly evolving, and there are no limits to what it can achieve.

“The guitar is a very versatile instrument, and there are so many possibilities for exploration,” said Grigoryan. “I hope people will be drawn into the music on this album, and come away with a new appreciation for what the guitar can do.”

#  Risky new performance sees Pound testing his skills with Russian guitar roulette

 Professional daredevil and thrill seeker, Pound, has embarked on a new risky venture that is seeing him testing his skills with Russian guitar roulette. The game, which is popular in Russia, sees a player take on the challenge of playing a guitar with a number of knives sticking out of it.

In fact, there have even been calls for him to take the challenge to more dangerous heights by incorporating other deadly objects into the game.

Whilst some may be critical of Pound's decision to take on such a dangerous stunt, there is no doubt that he is one of the most daring and bravest performers out there today. His willingness to put his life on the line for the entertainment of others is sure to continue to thrill and excite audiences around the world for years to come.
