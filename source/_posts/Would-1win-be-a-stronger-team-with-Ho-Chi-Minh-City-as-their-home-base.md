#  Would 1win be a stronger team with Ho Chi Minh City as their home base?

1win is a Vietnamese esports organization, currently competing in the League of Legends Continental League (LCL) - their home base is Ho Chi Minh City.

Would 1win be a stronger team with Ho Chi Minh City as their home base? This is a difficult question to answer. On the one hand, being based in Ho Chi Minh City would give the team easier access to practice partners and competition; on the other hand, it could be argued that playing in a more competitive league, such as the LPL, would provide greater opportunities for growth and exposure.

The LCL is a relatively new league, founded in 2017. It currently consists of nine teams, most of which are from Russia and Ukraine. The level of competition is not as high as in the LPL, which is widely considered to be one of the most competitive leagues in the world.

Given this, it is difficult to say whether 1win would be better off based in Ho Chi Minh City or not. However, what we can say is that the team has shown considerable promise so far, regardless of their home base. They finished first in their group during the LCL regular season and have since been crowned champions of the playoffs. This makes them one of the top teams in Southeast Asia - and they are only going to get better with time.

#  With the lockout over, will Viet Nam have an NHL team to root for this season?

Since the lockout is now over, the NHL will resume play in late January. For the first time ever, there will be a team from Viet Nam competing in the NHL. However, many are wondering if this new team will be able to compete with the well-established teams in the league.

The Viet Nam Oilers were founded last year by businessman Trần Đức Thảo. The team was created with the hope of bringing professional hockey to Viet Nam and giving its players a chance to compete against some of the best players in the world.

The Oilers have been working hard during the lockout to improve their skills and prepare for the upcoming season. They have been practicing every day at an ice rink in Saigon and have even recruited a few players from Canada and the United States to help them compete in the NHL.

Despite their preparations, many people are skeptical about whether or not they will be able to compete against teams like the Boston Bruins or the Montreal Canadiens. However, head coach Nguyen Quoc Ky remains confident that his team can hold their own against any opponent.

"Our goal is to be competitive and win as many games as we can," said Ky. "We know it's going to be tough but we're up for the challenge."

The Oilers will make their NHL debut on January 28 when they take on the Chicago Blackhawks. Tickets for that game have already sold out, so it looks like Viet Nam is definitely behind its new hockey team. Let's hope they can make everyone proud by winning some games and representing their country well!

#  If they debuted in the NHL this year, would Viet Nam be one of the weaker teams?

There is no clear answer, as the strength of Viet Nam’s ice hockey team would depend on a number of factors, including the rookies’ experience and skillset. With that said, it’s fair to say that Viet Nam would be towards the bottom of the pack if they debuted this year.

# Most teams in the NHL have players who have been playing together since they were kids, while Viet Nam’s roster would be filled with rookies

One of the biggest advantages that established NHL teams have is that most of their players have been playing together since they were kids. This allows them to develop chemistry and familiarity with each other which gives them a leg up when competing against teams with less cohesion. Viet Nam, on the other hand, would be fielding a team of rookies who have little or no experience playing together at the professional level. This would likely lead to some communication issues on the rink and a general lack of cohesiveness as a team.

#  How would the addition of Viet Nam to the NHL affect international hockey competition?

The announcement that Viet Nam will be joining the NHL in time for the 2020-21 season has generated a lot of excitement among hockey fans around the world. But what does this mean for international competition?

Some people have argued that adding Viet Nam to the NHL will give them an unfair advantage in international competition. But Viet Nam is a country with a rich history of hockey development, and they have already proved themselves to be a formidable opponent on the global stage.

In fact, the Vietnamese national team finished in fourth place at the 2019 IIHF World Championships, just behind Canada, Sweden and the United States. This was an impressive achievement, and it proves that Viet Nam is more than capable of holding its own against the best teams in the world.

So far, representatives from the Viet Nam Hockey Federation have said that they are looking forward to competing in the NHL. And with such a strong team already in place, there is no doubt that they will be a force to be reckoned with.

#  Who would be the favourite to win the Stanley Cup if Viet Nam joined the NHL?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as the Stanley Cup would be a much more competitive tournament if Viet Nam were to join the NHL. However, we can make some informed guesses.

The strongest teams in the NHL are typically those from Canada and the United States. Viet Nam would likely struggle against these teams, as they have much more experience playing at a professional level. That said, Viet Nam would not be without a chance of winning the Stanley Cup. They would have to upset some of the top teams in the league, but it is not impossible.

In terms of individual players, Viet Nam would likely have several talented athletes. However, there is no one player who would stand out as being particularly exceptional. This could work either for or against them, as they may be difficult to match up against given their overall team strength, but they may also struggle to score goals if they are not able to rely on any one player in particular.

If Viet Nam were to join the NHL, it would be an interesting spectacle for fans around the world. There is no doubt that they would face some tough competition, but they could also surprise everyone by winning the Stanley Cup.
