#  Bundesliga: who will be crowned champions?

The Bundesliga is one of the most competitive leagues in Europe, with teams battling it out for the title every year. This season looks to be no different, with several teams vying for the top spot. In this article, we take a look at who is most likely to be crowned champions at the end of the season.

 Bayern Munich are the clear favourites to win the Bundesliga this year. They have been the dominant force in German football for the past few years, and there is no reason to believe that they won’t finish on top this season. The Bavarian club have been bolstered by the signing of James Rodriguez from Real Madrid, and they are expected to make a strong challenge for Champions League glory this year.

RB Leipzig were surprise title contenders last season, but they will find it tougher to finish in first place this time around. The Saxony club have lost some key players over the summer, including Naby Keita and Bernardo Silva, and they may not have enough depth to challenge Bayern Munich over the course of a full season.

Borussia Dortmund are another side who are likely to challenge for the title this year. They finished third last season, behind Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig, and they will be looking to go one better this time around. The arrival of Andriy Yarmolenko from Dynamo Kyiv has given them a boost ahead of the new season, and they will be optimistic of finishing in first place.

The team that could potentially upset the status quo are Schalke 04. The Gelsenkirchen club finished a disappointing 10th last season, but they have made some impressive signings over the summer, including Breel Embolo from Basel and Amine Harit from Nantes. If Schalke can gel quickly as a team, they could be serious challengers for Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.
